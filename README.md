Netflix is a subscription-based streaming platform that allows users to watch movies and TV shows without advertisements. One of the reasons behind the popularity of Netflix is its recommendation system. Its recommendation system recommends movies and TV shows based on the user’s interest.
If you are a Data Science student and want to learn how to create a Netflix recommendation system, this code is for you. This code will take you through how to build a Netflix recommendation system using Python.

# Here’s How Netflix Recommendation System Works
The recommendation system of Netflix shows you movies and TV shows according to your interests. Netflix has a lot of data because of its user base. Its recommendation system predicts a personalised catalogue for you based on factors like:
1. your viewing history
2. the viewing history of other users with similar tastes and preferences as yours
3. genres, category, description, and more information about the content that you watched in the past

The genre of the content is one of the most valuable factors that helps Netflix recommend more content even to new users. I hope you have understood how Netflix recommends content to its users. I will take you through how to build a Netflix recommendation system using Python.

# Summary
The recommendation system of Netflix predicts a personalised catalogue for you based on factors like your viewing history, the viewing history of other users with similar tastes and preferences, and the genres, category, descriptions, and more information of the content you watched. I hope you liked this code on building a Netflix Recommendation System using Python.
